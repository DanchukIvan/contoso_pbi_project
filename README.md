The repository contains the sources of the Power BI <img src="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Icons/blob/main/PNG/Power-BI.png"  width="2%" height="2%"> dashboard, completed as a pet project :student: in the process of learning Power BI and DAX. The data used is synthetic and generated using [Contoso Data Generator](https://github.com/sql-bi/Contoso-Data-Generator.git).

In total, the dashboard has **7 pages, 160+ measures (including formatting and object-specific measures)**, and the model consists of **20 tables**. The fact table around which the calculations were based contains more than **200K** rows.

The report is not adapted for viewing on a smartphone.

The report is saved as a power bi project (.pbib format, see more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-overview)) for the purpose of git integration, but you can download a regular .pbix file and necessary assets from the Simple pbix folder.

The repo sources contain:

* [assets](https://github.com/DanchukIvan/contoso_pbi_project/tree/main/Simple%20pbix/Assets) - icons, source files for underlays and ready-made underlay files.
* [sql queries](https://github.com/DanchukIvan/contoso_pbi_project/tree/main/SQL%20Queries) - the text of the sql queries used to create additional tables to those generated by CDG[^1].  These queries are written in the MS SQL Server dialect.
* [database backup](https://github.com/DanchukIvan/contoso_pbi_project/tree/main/SqlBackup) - file with a database dump generated by CDG. This dump does not contain additional tables.
* folders with *'E2E Report'* prefix - contain metadata and project content presented in formats that allow you to track changes in the report in more detail.

Some repository folders may provide additional explanations regarding their contents.
